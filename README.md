# HellenicArcInputFiles
Here you can find the input files for the current HA simulations

1. Reference model, using: material.yaml, 120_initial_stress.yaml, fault_gaussian_east_30km.yaml, parameters.yaml and the rhomulambda_adapted2.yaml
2. Reference model with western hypocenter, using: fault_gaussian_west_30km.yaml 
3. Model including off-fault plasticity: using material_base.yaml or material_weak.yaml (for weak or "normally" constrained sediments) and parameters_off.par
4. Smalles earthquake generated with: 120_initial_stress_dip25.yaml, which changes the dip of the non-andersonian setup to 25Â°
5. Andersonian setup, using: 120_anderson.yaml
